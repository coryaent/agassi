# Agassi
"They call me Andre Agassi, I dominate the server."</br>

## Overview
Agassi is inspired by the setup detailed at [Docker Swarm Rocks](https://dockerswarm.rocks/). When Traefik dropped support for distributed certificate storage, it created a situation all certificates were stored locally on a single machine. This removed redundency from the setup.

By taking advantage of Docker Swarm's built-in state management, Agassi is able to run entirely in memory without the use of generative templates.

## Before You Begin
Agassi uses docker swarm's secret feature to securely store sensitive data. You will need two RSA keys, one of which is the key to access your ACME account, and the other of which is used for certificate signing requests (for both ACME certificates and self-signed certificates.) Agassi will create a new, self-signed certificate each time it starts.

Secrets can be created with openssl:
```
openssl genrsa 4096 | docker secret create acme.key
```
```
openssl genrsa 4096 | docker secret create agassi.key
```

## Configuration
The Agassi service can be run with several options, set with either command arguments or environment variables. Command arguments take precedent over environmental variables. Configuration options with default values are required.

| CMD               | ENV               | Default                   | Description                                               |
| :-:               | :-:               | :-:                       | :-                                                        |
| `-p`, `--persist` | `PERSIST`         | --                        | Directory to persist certificates, defaults to in-memory  |
| `-e`, `--email`   | `ACCOUNT_EMAIL`   | --                        | Email for certificate status updates                      |
| `--account-key`   | `ACCOUNT_KEY`     | `/run/secrets/acme.key`   | Path to RSA key used to login to your ACME account        |
| `--default-key`   | `DEFAULT_KEY`     | `/run/secrets/agassi.key` | Path to RSA key used to sign your CSR's                   |

### docker secrets
- RSA key (for Let's Encrypt account)
```shell
openssl genrsa 4096 | docker secret create agassi-account-key -
```
- OpenSSL key/self-signed certificate pair (for SSL server)
```shell
export CERTNAME=agassi &&\
export DOMAIN=example.com &&\
openssl req \
-newkey rsa:4096 \  
-x509 -sha256 \
-days 3650 \
-nodes \
-out /tmp/${CERTNAME}.crt \
-keyout /tmp/${CERTNAME}.key \
-subj "/CN=${DOMAIN}" &&\
docker secret create agassi-default-certificate /tmp/${CERTNAME}.crt &&\
docker secret create agassi-default-key /tmp/${CERTNAME}.key
```

### env
```shell
ETCD= # comma-seperated etcd hosts (string array) [required]
ACME_KEY= # PEM key for Let's Encrypt Account (file) [required]
DEFAULT_KEY= # SSL key for HTTPS server and Let's Encrypt CSR's (file) [required]
DEFAULT_CRT= # self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS server (file) [required]
EMAIL= # email to use for Let's Encrypt (file) [required]
ELECTION_DIR= # election directory in etcd2 (string) [default: /leader]
ELECTION_TTL= # TTL for leader elections (integer, seconds) [default: 10]
CHALLENGE_DIR= # etcd2 directory for ACME challenges (string) [default: /challenges]
CERT_DIR= #etcd2 directory for storing Let's Encrypt certs (string) [default: /certs]
VHOST_DIR= # etcd2 directory for virtual hosts (string) [default: /virtual-hosts]
STAGING= # do or do not use staging environment (boolean) [default: false]
RENEW_INTERVAL= # interval to check for expiring certs (integer, hours) [default: 6]
REALM= # displays on basic auth prompt (string) [default: Agassi]
```

## Usage
Each service requires the label `VIRTUAL_HOST` in order to register within Agassi. `VIRTUAL_HOST` is a URL with a protocol, your desired hostname, and a port number. For example, `http://example.com:8080` will be accessed at `https://example.com`. You do not need to set the destination host using `VIRTUAL_HOST`; it is read from the docker socket.

Optionally, a service may also utilize the label `VIRTUAL_AUTH` in order to requrie HTTP basic authentication. The encoding for the `VIRTUAL_AUTH` label can be generated using bcrypt via `htpasswd` and `base64`.
For example:
```shell
export VIRTUAL_AUTH=$(htpasswd -n -B -C 12 user | base64 -w 0)
```
You will be prompted for your password twice, including verification. Brypt is required to securely store the password hash in etcd, and base64 is requried to get rid of `$` characters, which cause general wonkiness in bash.

## Data
Data is stored persistently in etcd and cached in-memory using ES6 Maps.

### Docker Services
Docker services are stored in a Map such that a docker service ID points to a virtual host domain. This enables the removal of virtual hosts on the removal of docker services. Service ID's are stored in etcd within virtual hosts.

### Certificates
Certificates are stored within etcd, seperately from virtual hosts. This allows the use of etcd's native TTL in correspondence with certificate expiration.

### Virtual Hosts
```js
VirtualHost {
    serviceID: /* docker service ID */ ,
    auth: /* htpasswd bcrypt */ ,
    options: {
        /* proxy options */
    }
}
```
